This project is meant to be an aggregation of basic and intermediate python knowledge. I try to strike a balance between comprehensiveness and enough explanation so as to be usable by what i assume to be the average python user. Note that content is biased towards data exploration/analysis/science and not production ready code. 


Python_compendium.ipynb:  
This notebook summarizes usefull python knowledge. While very basic concepts are included out of a sense of comprehensiveness, multiple methods to achieve similar results are generally not. Due to length it is advised to view this notebook in an ide which includes a table of contents.

mv_functions.ipynb:  
Contains utility functions. They were mostly written for data exploration and to add convenience and are not geared towards production ready code.
mv_functions.py is meant for importing the functions in python scripts and notebooks, while mv_functions.ipynb is meant to improve the functions and write new ones.
Therefore the last section of the notebook saves the current mv_functions.py file with a timestamp, and transforms mv_functions.ipynb into a new .py file.
Some usage examples can be found in the last chapter of Python_compendium.ipynb.
