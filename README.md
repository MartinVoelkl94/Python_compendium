This is a work in progress collection of my python knowledge and functions. 
While the original files are quite expansive, some parts are not quite cleaned up and are in need of a consistent format and style.
I generally apply pep8 styleguidelines but decided to play loose with some of the conventions where i deem it appropiate.
I will update the files with the missing sections as they are cleaned up.


Python_compendium.ipynb:  
The original of this file is a compromise between documenting my acquired python knowledge and keeping it concise so as to more easily find specific information.
Nowadays i mostly use it to refresh my knowedge on those concepts i use less often or to look up syntax.
Still i also kept quite a bit of more trivial information (especially in the first few sections) out of a sense of comprehensiveness.
This compromise also pertains to the documentation where i had to balance explaining concepts vs size and readability of the document.
This also meant commiting a major pep8 crime by ignoring 80 char line length for comments, sorry guido.

mv_functions.ipynb:  
The original of this notebook contains my functions.
They were mostly written for data exploration and to add convenience and are not geared towards production ready code.
While i have a .py file for import in python scripts and notebooks i prefer to work on and improve my functions in a notebook.
Therefore the last section saves the current mv_functions.py file with a timestamp, and transforms mv_functions.ipynb into a new .py file.
